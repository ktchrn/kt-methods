\section{Results}

\subsection{The V LSR($\ell$, b, d) cube}
state the "final" parameter set
show some velocity pies
maybe show some neat distance or $\ell$ slices? 1d profiles should probably be saved for the spiral shocks paper

\subsection{Rotation curve}
maybe discuss peculiar velocity scales? our velocity dispersion along the rotation axis should be pretty similar to Clemensâ€™s line-of-sight RMS value emphasize that we trust our solution a few kpc outside of the solar circle, which is not true of Clemens or more recent gas work emphasize shape similarity within solar circle, but note dependence on assumptions about solar orbit parameters, differences in on-sky locations of tracers
