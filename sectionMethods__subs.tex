\section{Methods}

\subsection{KT / guided gaussian decomposition}

\subsubsection{Sketch}
"points" in space with single-ish distance, velocity
move points in velocity while keeping them fixed in distance
smooth things out

\subsubsection{Description of system being solved}
objective function including smoothing term
what is uncertainty

\subsubsection{Practical aspects}
choosing delta v window, smoothing parameter values
use figure \ref{fig:smoothing_effects} to explain how varying the smoothing parameter affects the solution in clean, medium, busy sightline regimes
