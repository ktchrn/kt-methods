Colors show the difference between an observed or estimated $\vlos$ and the value predicted from a flat rotation curve. The background is an average of the PPD velocity field over $-2.5\deg \leq \glat \leq +2.5\deg$. The color of the inner part of each circle is the $\vlos$ of an HMSFR. The color of the outer ring of each circle is the value of the PPD velocity field at the position (including $\glat$) of the HMSFR.
