\label{fig:tracer_syst_values}

Total ISM column, integrated along the line of sight, as derived from $\HI$ and CO emission (x-axis) and reddening(y-axis). Regions with markedly less dust-derived column than gas-derived column are marked in blue and red and correspond to the blue and red regions in figure \ref{fig:tracer_syst_spatial}.
