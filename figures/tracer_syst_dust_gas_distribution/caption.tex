Column densities derived by collapsing the E(B-V)-derived PPP cube along the distance axis versus column densities derived by collapsing the $\HI$- and CO-emission derived PPV cube along the velocity axis. We highlight column density regimes in which many sightlines tend to have smaller reddening-derived columns than gas-emission-derived columns in blue and red. The spatial distribution of sightlines in the blue and red selection boxes is shown in figure \ref{fig:tracer_syst_spatial}.
