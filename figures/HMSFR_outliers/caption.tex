\label{fig:outliers}
\textbf{(Left)} The distribution of residuals per uncertainty (\textit{standardized} residuals) between the observed and KT-derived line-of-sight velocities of HMSFRs (filled histogram), with an appropriately scaled standard normal distribution for reference (empty histogram). We consider HMSFRs with $\vert \Delta v / \sigma \vert > 3$ to be outliers. In all three panels, outliers are denoted in orange and non-outliers are denoted in blue. \textbf{(Middle)} The distribution of the HMSFRs' Galactocentric radii. 
The solid black line shows the mean number of outliers expected in each interval, assuming that the rate of outliers in an interval is drawn from a Poisson distribution with rate the number of HMSFRs in that interval times $^{5}/_{99}$, the fraction of outliers in the sample. The dashed and dotted lines show the corresponding 95th and 99th percentile levels.
\textbf{(Right)} The locations of the outliers and non-outliers in heliocentric Cartesian coordinates, where $\mathrm{X_{HC}}$ increases towards $\glon=0^\circ$ and $\mathrm{Y_{HC}}$ increases towards $\glon=90^\circ$.
