\label{fig:outliers}
\textbf{(Left)} The distribution of residuals per uncertainty (\textit{standardized} residuals) between the observed and KT-derived line-of-sight velocities of HMSFRs (filled histogram), with an appropriately scaled standard normal distribution for reference (empty histogram). We consider HMSFRs with $\vert \Delta v / \sigma \vert > 3$ to be outliers. In all three panels, outliers are denoted in orange and non-outliers are denoted in blue. \textbf{(Middle)} The distribution of the HMSFRs' Galactic longitudes. 
The solid black line shows the median number of outliers expected in each longitude interval, assuming that the rate of outliers in an interval is drawn from a Poisson distribution with rate the number of HMSFRs in that interval times $^{5}/_{99}$, the fraction of outliers in the sample. The dashed lines show the corresponding 16th and 84th percentile levels.
\textbf{(Right)} The locations of the outliers in heliocentric Cartesian coordinates, where $\mathrm{X_{HC}}$ increases towards $\glon=0^\circ$ and $\mathrm{Y_{HC}}$ increases towards $\glon=90^\circ$. Most of the HMSFRs are outside of the area shown in this panel but all five of the outliers lie here, between 3 and 5 kpc from the Galactic center.
