\label{fig:outliers}
\textbf{(Left)} The distribution of residuals per uncertainty (\textit{standardized} residuals) between the observed and KT-derived line-of-sight velocities of HMSFRs. We consider HMSFRs with $\vert \Delta v / \sigma \vert > 3$ to be outliers. In all three panels, outliers are denoted in orange and non-outliers are denoted in blue. \textbf{(Middle)} The distribution of the HMSFRs' heliocentric distances. \textbf({Right}) The locations of the outliers in ($\mathrm{X_{HC}}$, $\mathrm{Y_HC})$ coordinates, where $\mathrm{X_HC}$ increases towards $\glon=0^\circ$ and $\mathrm{Y_HC}$ increases towards $\glon=90^\circ$. Most of the HMSFRs lie outside of the area shown in this panel. All five of the outliers lie between 3 and 5 kpc from the Galactic center.
