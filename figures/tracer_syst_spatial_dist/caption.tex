\label{fig:tracer_syst_spatial}

The spatial distribution of the dust-derived column density with regions with less dust-derived than gas-derived total columns highlighted in blue and red; the color coding corresponds to the blue and red selection boxes in figure \ref{fig:tracer_syst_values}. The locations of high-mass star forming regions are marked in orange.
