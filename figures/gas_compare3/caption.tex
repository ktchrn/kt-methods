The interstellar medium in the Galactic plane, shown in three tracers: reddening (top), HI (middle), and CO (bottom). Each shows the total column measured by each tracer, with a log intensity stretch. The regions are 360 degrees in Galactic longitude wide, centered on Galactic Center, and 60 degrees in Galactic latitude tall, centered on the Galactic plane.
