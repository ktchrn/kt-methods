\section{Introduction}
Many of the open problems in star formation, molecular cloud evolution, and galaxy-scale gas dynamics remain open because it has not been possible to measure the most useful instantaneous quantity for resolving them -- the vector field of 3D gas velocity as a function of 3D position, which we will call the 3-velocity field -- over an extended area of sky.
Since non-line-of-sight velocities are derived from proper motions, which cannot be reliably measured for extended sources, 3-velocity fields are likely to remain inaccessible. 
For many of these open problems, a measurement of the line-of-sight velocity as a function of 3D position, the 1-velocity field, would be enough to make non-trivial progress. 
We have developed a method for deriving 1-velocity fields of the interstellar medium in the Milky Way from position-position-velocity and position-position-position measurements. 

This method can be understood as a variation on CfR's extension of kinematic distances.
The kinematic distance to a point at some on-sky position ($\ell$, b) and line-of-sight velocity $v$ is the distance at which a model of gas motion in that ($\ell$, b) direction is equal to $v$.
The gas motion model is usually taken to be a galactic rotation curve. 

Kinematic distances have several well-known drawbacks.
Firstly, they are not unique in directions where different distances are assigned the same line-of-sight velocity.
When a flat rotation curve is assumed, sightlines inside the solar circle and towards the galactic anti-center do not have unique distances. 
Next, kinematic distances ignore the possibility of deviations from the gas motion model.
Measurements of the distances and line-of-sight velocities of point-like objects such as masers show that deviations from azimuthally symmetric rotation, or streaming motions, are the norm rather than the exception.
In some cases, streaming motions can mean that there is no distance corresponding to a given velocity. 
This is known to happen towards the galactic anti-center CITE and near the galactic center CITE.
Finally, computing kinematic distances for an entire PPV dataset yields a PPP dataset, trading one map of three-dimensional structure for another.
Despite these drawbacks, kinematic distances are an adequate estimate of actual distances over much of the galactic plane.

CfR's method improves on kinematic distances by treating them as one of a number of context clues to the distance to an object.
Other context clues include the physical size and height above the galactic plane that a distance would imply given the object's angular size and height above the galactic plane, the presence or absence of H I 21cm self-absorption in the direction of the object, and the distances to any other objects that are known to be close to the object of interest.
If there are enough context clues, this approach can help resolve the degeneracy between distances that correspond to the same line-of-sight velocity and can be used to detect and measure streaming motions.


because there have been large IR/optical photometric surveys, there are now also pretty good PPP cubes, which trace out the shape of the ISM in the three spatial dimensions. 
our thing is taking a PPP cube and doing the complement of what OCP\&R do with PPV cubes -- use "context clues" to figure out their velocities.
in our case, context clues are (1) PPV cubes; (2) plausible velocity ranges given a distance, rotation curve, and a peculiar velocity distribution; and (3) the velocities of neighboring PPP voxels. 
a parallel construction -- you have masses at sites in 3-space and you want to assign line-of-site velocities to them in such a way that (1) the resulting PPV cube looks like the actual PPV cube; (2) the velocities make sense given our knowledge of the rotation curve and typical deviations from it; and (3) masses that are nearby in space together will usually have similar velocities.

we need to check our answers
compare azimuthal averages to old azimuthal averages (rotation curves)
compare our velocity to the measured velocity at positions of point-like things for which precise 3-positions and velocities exist (masers)
very good agreement with point-like comparison, mostly agreement with rotation curves suggests we can probably trust the results
