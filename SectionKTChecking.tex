\subsection{Checking the KT solution}
\label{sec:KT-validation}

We have used the unregularized and regularized versions of the kinetic tomography technique to derive PPPV 4-cubes for the region of the galactic plane with $0^\circ < \ell < 220^\circ$ and $-10^\circ < b < 10^\circ$. %We will refer to these two solutions by the names of their methods, i.e. as the UKT and RKT solutions.
These solutions can be thought of as either one 4D map of the ISM density in PPPV space or as a set of three 3D maps of ISM density, central velocity, and velocity dispersion in PPP space. One benefit of the ``three 3D maps'' representation is that the accuracy of each of the three maps can be checked separately. The accuracy of the 3D ISM density map is discussed in Schlafly+. In this section, we check the accuracy of the UKT and RKT central velocity maps against the R14 dataset, which is described in section \ref{sec:data-HMSFR}. We find that the UKT and RKT are clear improvements over flat and non-flat rotation curves, and that the RKT solution is statistically consistent within the uncertainties with the R14 measurements. 

The quantities we are comparing are the line-of-sight velocity of a high-mass star forming region (HMSFR) from R14 and the central velocity at the $\ell$, $b$, and distance of the HMSFR. To compute this central velocity, we take the $\mu(d)$ profile of the $\ell$, $b$ cell that contains the $\ell$ and $b$ of the HMSFR, linearly interpolate $\mu(d)$ between the centers of the distance bins, and evaluate this piecewise linear $\mu(d)$ profile at the distance of the HMSFR given by R14. We estimate the uncertainty of this velocity by propagating the distance uncertainty of the HMSFR to a $\mu(d)$ uncertainty. The typical magnitude of this uncertainty is 3-5 km/sec; Figure (HMSFR on profile) shows an HMSFR for which this uncertainty is particularly large. We also compute the $v_{los}$ predicted for each HMSFR by the CLEMENS1984 rotation curve; we refer to these $v_{los}$ values as the C84 values. 

Figure (maser comp) compares the measured maser $v_{los}$ to the C84, UKT, and  RKT values. There is a clear improvement in agreement from the C84 to the UKT to the RKT velocities. UKT is also a good fit to the R14 measurements in an absolute sense. On a qualitative level, the error bars on RKT's panel of Figure (maser comp) tend to be close to the one-to-one line. 

For a slightly more quantitative assessment, we can analyze the distribution of \emph{standardized residuals} -- residuals divided by uncertainties. This distribution is shown in Figure (resid). For comparison, the figure also shows a normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation one, a \emph{standard normal} distribution. If the uncertainties are accurate and errors are normally distributed, the standardized residuals should be a draw from the standard normal distribution. Of the 99 HMSFRs that fall within our l and b range, 6 have residuals that are more than three standard deviations away from zero; we discuss these six in section \ref{sec:discussion-catastrophic}. The standardized residuals of the remaining 93 objects are not inconsistent with being drawn from the standard normal distribution. The RKT solution is statistically consistent with 93 of the 99 HMSFRs in its lb range. We discuss what this means for the more global accuracy of the RKT solution in section \ref{sec:discussion-systematics}.
