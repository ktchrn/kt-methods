\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}
\subsection{KT / guided gaussian decomposition}

\subsubsection{Sketch}
"points" in space with single-ish distance, velocity
move points in velocity while keeping them fixed in distance
smooth things out

\subsubsection{Description of system being solved}
objective function including smoothing term
what is uncertainty

\subsubsection{Practical aspects}
choosing delta v window, smoothing parameter values
use figure \ref{fig:smoothing_effects} to explain how varying the smoothing parameter affects the solution in clean, medium, busy sightline regimes

local vs. global solutions, possibility of multiple solutions
point out uniqueness issues
convince audience that we're finding global-ish solutions by showing solutions converged on from different initial conditions in figure?

\subsection{Rotation curve fitting}
functional form -- piecewise flat 
right now, uncorrelated dispersions -- expand to correlated ones?
should probably worry about radial binning scheme more than I do at the moment
north vs. south-ish?
fixed solar velocity vector, solar position
