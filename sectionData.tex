\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}
\subsection{HI and CO cubes}
sources and regridding process
post-processing, which includes multiplying by constants to get H nucleon counts and median filtering in lb space to get rid of single voxel artifacts in the CO map

\subsection{Reddening cube}
source, regridding process?
brief rundown of how these are made
post-processing, aka multiplying by a constant

\subsection{Reid masers}
final source
processing to get to distances (just a conversion from parallax) and line-of-sight velocities
how many/which ones we exclude due to lack of overlap with reddening cube
