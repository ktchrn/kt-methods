emphasize how really cool this is, but mention caveats

do we want to talk about the remaining v lsr residuals between gas and masers or not?

\subsection{Known systematics}
to what extent is a gaussian an adequate description of the PDF for a PPP voxel's uncertainty? more generally, what shape do we expect that to take?

\subsubsection{Issues with the reddening cube}
the shape of distance uncertainties
distance dropout
high Av dropout

\subsubsection{The tracer to nucleon conversion}
how badly do deviations from our assumptions about nucleon - HI and CO emission and nucleon - EBV mess us up?
large non-linearity, small area -- self-absorption
medium non-linearity, medium area -- CO-dark H2
small non-linearity, medium-large area -- Rv variations

\subsection{The precision and accuracy of V LSR($\ell$, b, d)}
given (1) the masers and (2) the known systematics, how accurate and precise do we think a PPP voxel's velocity is?
