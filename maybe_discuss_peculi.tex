maybe discuss peculiar velocity scales? our velocity dispersion along the rotation axis should be pretty similar to Clemens's line-of-sight RMS value
emphasize that we trust our solution a few kpc outside of the solar circle, which is not true of Clemens or more recent gas work
emphasize shape similarity within solar circle, but note dependence on 
assumptions about solar orbit parameters, differences in on-sky locations of tracers
