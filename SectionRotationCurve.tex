\section{The rotation curve of the Milky Way and spatially coherent streaming motions}
\label{sec:rotation_curve}

\subsection{The rotation curve}
\label{sec:rotation_fit}
The Milky Way ISM's velocity field can be considered a as a composition of the Galactic rotation curve and streaming motions. 
The magnitude and radial dependence of the rotation curve contain information on the integral and radial profile of the Galaxy's mass distribution and streaming motions indicate perturbations in the Galactic potential, such as spiral arms and the bar.
Since there are many derivations of the Galactic rotation curve in the literature, we can also use it as a check of the accuracy of our $\vlos$ map on large spatial scales, complementing the previous section's validation on small spatial scales.

We derive the Galactic rotation curve by comparing the observed $\vlos(\glon, d)$ to line-of-sight velocities corresponding to different combinations of rotation curves and Galactic parameters. 
The line-of-sight velocity $\vlos$ at a Galactic longitude $\glon$ and heliocentric distance $d$ in the Galactic plane (meaning at $\glat=0^\circ$) is 
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:vlos_mean}
\vlos(\glon, d) = \frac{V_\phi (\RGC) R_\odot \sin\glon}{\RGC} + 
\frac{V_R (\RGC) \left(R_\odot \cos \glon + d (1 - 2 \cos^2 \glon)  \right) }{\RGC} - V_{\phi, \odot} \sin \glon + V_{R, \odot} \cos \glon,
\end{equation}
where $V_\phi$ and $V_R$ are azimuthal (increasing clockwise) and radial (increasing outward from the Galactic center) velocities, $R_\odot$, $V_{\phi, \odot}$, and $V_{R, \odot}$ are the Galactocentric radius, azimuthal velocity, and radial velocity of the Sun, and $\RGC$ is the Galatocentric distance to the point specified by $\glon$ and $d$:
\begin{equation}
\RGC = \sqrt{R^2_\odot + d^2 - 2 R_\odot d \cos \glon}.
\end{equation}
Here, we have assumed that $V_\phi$ and $V_R$ depend only on $\RGC$, meaning that they are constant as a function of Galactic azimuth.
We will assume that there are no azimuthally constant radial flows, meaning that $V_R(\RGC) \equiv 0\text{ km/sec}$.
Following, e.g., \citet{Reid:2009jb} and \citet{Bovy_2009}, we allow for non-zero azimuthal and radial velocity dispersions, parametrized as independent normal distributions. 
In this parametrization, the line-of-sight velocity dispersion at a single location is a normal distribution with variance
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:vlos_var}
\sigma^2_\mathrm{los} = \left(\sigma_\phi \frac{R_\odot \sin \glon}{\RGC} \right)^2 + 
\left(\sigma_R  \frac{R_\odot \cos \glon + d (1 - 2 \cos^2 \glon)}{\RGC} \right)^2,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_\phi$ and $\sigma_R$ are the standard deviations of the azimuthal and radial velocity dispersions. 

We use two models for the rotation curve and other Galactic parameters. 
In the first case, we assume a flat rotation curve, expressed as a single radially constant $V_\phi(\RGC) \equiv V_\phi$, and solve for the best-fit $V_\phi$, $V_{\phi, \odot}$, $V_{R, \odot}$, $\RGC$, $\sigma_\phi$, and $\sigma_R$. 
In the second, we assume a continuous, piecewise linear rotation curve and fix the Galactic parameters to a fiducial set of values -- $\RGC = 8.1\text{ kpc}$, $V_{\phi, \odot} - V_{\phi} = 15.3 \text{ km/sec}$, and $V_{R, \odot} = - 10.3 \text{ km/sec}$. 
In the first case, we only use $\vlos$ measurements within the nearest 4 kpc.
This avoids the inner 4 kpc of the Galaxy, where the rotation curve is known to be non-flat.
In the second case, we use $\vlos$ measurements that are between 2 and 15 kpc from the Galactic center on the near side of the Galaxy. 
The breakpoints of the piecewise linear curve are placed every 0.25 kpc.

Our results for the parameters of the first model are $\RGC=8.90 \pm 0.04 \text{ kpc}$, $V_\phi = 279 \pm 1.5 \text{ km/sec}$, $V_{\phi, \odot} - V_\phi = 28.5 \pm 0.1 \text{ km/sec}$, and $V_{R, \odot} = 6.2 \pm 0.1 \text{ km/sec}$.
While the formal uncertainties on these values are small, we can tell that the systematic uncertainties must be large, particularly on $\RGC$ and $V_\phi$, because the results depend strongly on which portion of the measurements we include in the fit.
The parameter values we give above use the measurements from the nearest 4 kpc of the Galactic disk.
If we instead use measurements from the nearest 3 kpc, we find that $\RGC$ changes to $8.05 \pm 0.06 \text{ kpc}$ and $V_\phi$ remains unchanged, while if we use measurements from the nearest 6 kpc and exclude the inner Galaxy by only using sightlines with $\glon > 45^\circ$, we get $\RGC = 7.43 \pm 0.03 \text{ kpc}$ and $V_\phi = 223 \pm 1 \text{ km/sec}$.
We believe the cause of these large changes in parameter values is that as we vary the region being analyzed, we include and exclude different large-scale streaming motions. 
Since these large-scale streaming motions are not included in the model specification, they end up dragging parameters in different directions.
We discuss this further in Section \ref{sec:rotation_discussion}.

The piecewise-linear rotation curve is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rotation_curves}, with the \Clemens rotation curve for comparison. 
These two non-flat rotation curves mostly agree, in the sense that deviations from flat rotation have the same sign, if not always the same magnitude.

\subsection{Spatially coherent streaming motions}
\label{sec:rotation_discussion}
In Figure \ref{fig:six_pies}, we show residuals between the $\vlos$ measurements and (panel b) the flat rotation curve derived from the nearest 4 kpc and (panel c) the piecewise-linear rotation curve. 
For comparison, we also show residuals between the $\vlos$ measurements and (panel a) our fiducial flat rotation curve and Galactic parameters, (panel d) the \Clemens non-flat rotation curve, (panel e) the \cite{2012ApJ...759..131B} flat rotation curve, (panel f) and the \Reid A5 model flat rotation curve.
In every panel, there are obvious, multi-kpc regions with consistent non-zero velocity residuals.
Most of these regions persist across all six panels, though there is some panel-to-panel variation in the exact bounds and residual magnitude of each region. 
For example, there is always a blue-shifted feature just outside the solar circle at $90^\circ \lesssim \glon \lesssim 180^\circ$, a smaller red-shifted feature $\approx 12$ kpc from the Galactic center at the high-$\glon$ boundary of the map, and another red-shifted feature just inside the solar circle. 

Persistence across different sets of rotation curves and Galactic parameters merely provides evidence that the spatially coherent residuals are not caused by a misspecification of the global Galactic motion and geometry.
We can argue for the accuracy of most of the residual regions by taking the HMSFR measurements as truth and appealing to the regions' strong spatial coherence.
The argument goes as follows -- if the $\vlos$ map accurately predicts the velocities of HMSFRs that are spatially coincident with a specific residual region, it is reasonable to assume that the $\vlos$ values assigned to the rest of that region are also likely to be accurate. 
Based on the discussion in Section \ref{sec:KT-validation}, we can claim that the HMSFR velocities are accurately predicted everywhere outside of the inner 4-5 kpc of the Galaxy or so.
A visual inspection of Figure \ref{fig:maser_pie} shows that there are HMSFRs in every residual region within about 6 kpc of the Sun. 
We interpret the combination of these two facts as evidence that all of the residual regions shown in Figures \ref{fig:maser_pie} and \ref{fig:six_pies} outside of the inner 4-5 kpc of the galaxy are, in fact, actually present in the velocity field of the Milky Way ISM. 

Once we have established that the spatially-structured residuals are real, we can ask what they are.
In particular, we can ask what fraction of the residuals can be ascribed to radial rotation curve variations and what fraction should instead be interpreted as streaming motions. 
If we compare the residuals from the two radially-varying rotation curves in Figure \ref{fig:six_pies} (panels c and d) to the residuals from the four flat rotation curves (panels a, b, e, and f), the typical magnitudes of the former are clearly lower than typical magnitudes of the latter. 
While we could interpret this difference in residual magnitudes as evidence that the residuals are mostly attributable to radial rotation curve variations, that interpretation would only be true for a very empirical definition of a rotation curve.

We can consider two definitions of a rotation curve: the azimuthal average of the azimuthal component of the Galactic velocity field (empirical) and the circular velocity in the Galactic gravitational potential (theoretical), both of which may be functions of Galactocentric radius. 
If azimuthal departures from the theoretical rotation curve, i.e. azimuthal streaming motions, at some Galactocentric radius do not average to zero, then the empirical and theoretical rotation curves at that radius will not be equal. 
We are particularly prone to cross-talk between spatially coherent streaming motions and radial variations in the rotation curve because of the limited azimuthal coverage of our $\vlos$ measurements.
At some radii, a streaming motion that is coherent over a few kiloparsecs is enough to fill most of the azimuth range in our map at those radii. 
In the inner Galaxy, particularly near the tip of the Galactic bar, this danger has been pointed out by e.g. \citet{Chemin_2015}.
Those authors argue that most of the radial variations in the inner Galaxy in \Clemens, in particular, are actually streaming motions.
While our azimuth coverage is wider than that of \Clemens, the similarity in the rotation curve shapes (Figure rotation curves) suggests that the point still applies.

While \citet{Chemin_2015} assume that deriving the rotation curve in the outer Galaxy should be relatively free of hassle, extragalactic studies such as \citet{Meidt_2013} and (some of those Halpha ones) have shown that strongly spiral galaxies can have quite strong streaming motions far away from the bar. 
So, the advice seems to be to just steer clear of assuming fluctuations in azimuthal velocities have much to do with the theoretical rotation curve -- it's probably all streaming motions.
